# Color-Flipper

This is a website that randomly generates a background color and displays its color code.

It has two modes, the Simple mode and the Hex mode. 

In the Simple mode it randomly selects a background color from an array of colors. 

The Hex mode is more interesting tho, because it can generate "infinite" amount of colors. This means that there isn't
a fixed amount of colors, instead, it generates the colors on the fly.

This was a really fun and interesting project because I had to learn about how hexadecimal colors work so that I could develop 
the "logic" for generating pretty much any possible hex color.
